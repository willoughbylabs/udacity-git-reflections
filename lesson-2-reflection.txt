Q1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A1: initializing a repository allows git to start tracking changes. It is
needed otherwise changes won't be tracked and you can't make commits.

Q2: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

A2: The staging area is different from the working directory in that it only
has files that you'd like to commit. It is possible there are other files
in the working directory but they do not need to be a part of the commit.
